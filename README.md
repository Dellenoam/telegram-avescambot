# telegram-avescambot
This is a telegram bot that allows you to work with computers running remote access.

Remote access is through the [ScamBot program](https://github.com/NOOBSLAYER228/scamBot), which was developed by me and my friend

[AveScamBot site](https://github.com/Dellenoam/avescambot) that processes requests from telegram bots and computers

Through the telegram bot, you can upload data about the updated version of the program to the database, as well as send commands to be executed on computers

In this project you need to change some links and configurations.
